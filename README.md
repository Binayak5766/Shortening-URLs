# Shortening-URLs
This project shortens urls and stores them in a postgresql database.
So to use this app download the .zip file and extract it. Then run the executable.
Some things you have to make sure are as follows:
(i) Download the postgresql server and set it up in your machine.
(ii) Create a database named URLs.
(iii) Download chromedriver.exe and put it in the following path: 'C:/Program Files/chromedriver.exe'
After all this just enjoy the application and do tell me the feedback.
Currently I am working on to create a centralised database like AWS or Google cloud service. So if any of you are experienced in that area do mail me.

Before downloading the chromedriver do check the version of the chrome you are using.
